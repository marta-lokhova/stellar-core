/**
 * FloodGate keeps track of which peers have sent us which broadcast messages,
 * in order to ensure that for each broadcast message M and for each peer P, we
 * either send M to P once (and only once), or receive M _from_ P (thereby
 * inhibit sending M to P at all).
 *
 * The broadcast message types are TRANSACTION and SCP_MESSAGE.
 *
 * All messages are marked with the ledger sequence number to which they
 * relate, and all flood-management information for a given ledger number
 * is purged from the FloodGate when the ledger closes.

        //    just be delayed / sent twice by such accidental poisoning.
        //
        //  - Narrow the attack window for any _intentional_ poisoning to a
        //    short real-time window: attacker would have to find a SIPHash24
        //    preimage in the window of time between the LCL hash being known
